VirtualFit â€” AI-Powered Virtual Clothing Try-On

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
This project focuses on AI-based Virtual Try-On, where a user can upload a photo of a person and a piece of clothing, and the system will generate a new image showing how the person would look wearing that clothing.
We will use pretrained models like VITON-HD / TryOnDiffusion, so the system works even without training from scratch.
The goal is to demonstrate how computer vision can be used in e-commerce and fashion technology.

Objectives

Use ready-made AI models (VITON-HD / TryOnDiffusion) to generate try-on images.

Test the model on custom images or fashion dataset.

Produce Before vs After visuals to show clothing transfer effect.

Evaluate results visually and through image similarity metrics (SSIM, LPIPS).

Present the project as a real use case for online clothing stores.
